      "Explanation: Based on the current economic trends and market data up to January 2024, there is a high probability (75%) that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates by the end of Q2 2024. This prediction is based on various indicators such as inflation rates, employment numbers, GDP growth, and other economic data. However, it's important to note that economic conditions can change rapidly and unexpected events can occur, so there is always some level of uncertainty associated with these predictions.\n",

      "Explanation: Based on the current state of autonomous vehicle technology and regulatory frameworks, it is unlikely that a major Tesla launch a fully autonomous vehicle for consumer use by 2026. The probability score of 0.15 represents a low likelihood, while the confidence level of 0.9 indicates a high degree of certainty in this prediction.

      "The current trend in the cryptocurrency market is bullish with a significant increase in the prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past year. However, predicting that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 per coin within the next year involves a certain level of uncertainty due to various factors such as regulatory issues, market volatility, technological developments, and investor sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on current market trends and technical analysis, it is possible for Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs in the coming months or even years. However, reaching $100,000 per coin within the next year requires a substantial increase in price momentum, which is not guaranteed at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the probability score of this prediction is set to 0.25, indicating that there is a 25% chance of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 within the next year based on current market trends and conditions. The confidence level is set to \"Low\" due to the uncertainty surrounding regulatory issues and market volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that investing in cryptocurrencies involves significant risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Before making any investment decisions, it's recommended to conduct thorough research and consult with financial advisors or experts.\n",
